Personal Notes on Build:
----------------------------------

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter 
It removes all original styling* and ensures that all outputted code conforms to a consistent style. 
Prettier takes your code and reprints it from scratch by taking the line length into account.
Prettier enforces a consistent code style (i.e. code formatting that wonâ€™t affect the AST) across your entire codebase because it disregards the original styling* by parsing it away and re-printing the parsed AST with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.

Use .prettierignore to ignore (i.e. not reformat) certain files and folders completely.

ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs. In many ways, it is similar to JSLint and JSHint with a few exceptions:

ESLint uses Espree for JavaScript parsing.
ESLint uses an AST to evaluate patterns in code.
ESLint is completely pluggable, every single rule is a plugin and you can add more at runtime.
